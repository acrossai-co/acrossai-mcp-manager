# Decisions

## Entry Lifecycle

Each decision follows this lifecycle:

```
Active → Needs Review → Superseded → (pruned)
```

- **Active**: The decision is current and must be honored by all features and AI agents.
- **Needs Review**: Implementation reality or new context suggests this decision may be outdated. It should still be honored until reviewed and explicitly changed.
- **Superseded**: A newer decision has replaced this one. Keep it for historical context until the next audit, then consider pruning.
- **Pruned**: During an audit, remove superseded entries that no longer provide historical value. This keeps the file focused.

### When to change status

| Current Status | Change To    | When                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active         | Needs Review | Verified implementation or tests contradict the decision, or recurring features follow a different pattern |
| Active         | Superseded   | A newer decision explicitly replaces this one                                                              |
| Needs Review   | Active       | Team confirms the decision still holds after review                                                        |
| Needs Review   | Superseded   | Team confirms a replacement decision                                                                       |
| Superseded     | _(remove)_   | Audit finds no remaining historical value                                                                  |

### Rules

- Never delete an Active decision without replacing or superseding it.
- Never silently ignore a decision. If it feels wrong, mark it Needs Review and resolve it.
- Keep at most 3–5 Superseded entries for context. Prune older ones during audits.

### 2026-05-29 — PLUGIN_NAME_SLUG defined as literal string

**Status**
Active

**Context**
`define_constants()` in `includes/Main.php` runs before any properties are
set in the constructor. `$this->plugin_name` is null at that call site.

**Decision**
`ACROSSAI_MCP_MANAGER_PLUGIN_NAME_SLUG` MUST be defined as the literal string
`'acrossai-mcp-manager'`, not `$this->plugin_name`.
`get_plugin_name()` continues returning `$this->plugin_name` (not the constant)
to avoid touching every caller and to prevent ordering bugs in test bootstraps
that don't load the full plugin. Both hold the same value — the return source
is an explicit design choice.

**Rationale**
`define()` silently accepts null. Using `$this->plugin_name` (null) would
define the constant as an empty string — a silent misconfiguration.

**Alternatives rejected**
- Reorder constructor so `$this->plugin_name` is set first — rejected; it
  changes the boot contract (define_constants always runs first, FR-001).
- Return the constant from `get_plugin_name()` — rejected; changes every
  caller and introduces an ordering dependency in test bootstraps.

### 2026-05-29 — Rewrite rules registered immediately at activation

**Status**
Active

**Context**
`FrontendAuth` and `ClaudeConnectors` handler classes do not exist at plugin
activation time (they are implemented in Phases 3 and 6 respectively).

**Decision**
Register rewrite rules with placeholder query vars at activation using literal
path strings (not class constants). Requests to these paths return a graceful
WordPress 404 until the handler classes are implemented. No deferral, no
conditional registration.

**Rationale**
Deferral approaches (deferred registration, or conditional on class_exists)
would require a separate rewrite flush later and could leave site permalinks
in an inconsistent state. Registering immediately ensures routes are always
present from first activation.

**Alternatives rejected**
- Defer registration until handler class is registered via a hook — rejected;
  adds complexity, requires an extra flush event later.
- Use class constants (`FrontendAuth::PAGE_SLUG`) — rejected; classes don't
  exist at activation time, causing a fatal.

### 2026-05-29 — Compat.php placed in includes/ not includes/Utilities/

**Status**
Active

**Context**
Constitution Principle I says shared logic MUST go in `includes/Utilities/`.
`Compat.php` is a shared utility. However, the boot flow loads Compat BEFORE
other Utilities/ classes are available (it provides PHP 7.4 polyfill guards
used by early-loading code).

**Decision**
`includes/Compat.php` with namespace `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes` is an
accepted exception to Principle I. This is documented as DEV2 in INDEX.md.

**Rationale**
`Compat` is a boot-time compat shim, not a feature-level utility. Placing it
in `Utilities/` would create an autoloader ordering dependency at PHP < 8.0.
The existing source (`src/Core/Compat.php`) confirms the `Core` placement
pattern.

**Alternatives rejected**
- `includes/Utilities/Compat.php` — rejected; autoloader resolves Utilities/
  after includes/ classes in some edge cases on PHP 7.4.

### 2026-05-29 — class_exists() guards in Activator are always silent no-op

**Status**
Active

**Context**
DB Query classes (`MCPServer\Query`, `CliAuthLog\Query`,
`ConnectorAuditLog\Query`) do not exist until Phase 4.

**Decision**
Every DB call in `Activator::activate()` MUST be guarded with
`class_exists( ClassName::class )`. If the class is absent, the call is
silently skipped — no log entry, no wp_options flag, no admin notice.

**Rationale**
Silent skip prevents activation failure on fresh installs where Phase 4 has
not yet been merged. Logging a non-fatal notice would confuse administrators.

**Alternatives rejected**
- Hard-code the check and throw on failure — rejected; breaks fresh installs.
- Use `try/catch` — rejected; `class_exists` is cleaner and has no
  performance overhead.

### 2026-05-29 — PHPCS Baseline Exceptions in phpcs.xml.dist [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
Baseline exclusions are required for all phases until structural refactoring of the boilerplate is done.

**Decision**
Five rule groups are intentionally suppressed in `phpcs.xml.dist`: filename casing (`WordPress.Files.FileName`), `$_instance` underscore prefix (`PSR2.Classes.PropertyDeclaration.Underscore`), file docblocks (`Squiz.Commenting.FileComment`), `namespace Public` reserved keyword (`PHPCompatibility.Keywords.ForbiddenNames`, `Universal.NamingConventions.NoReservedKeywordParameterNames`), and PSR12 file-header order. Also suppressed: `CommentedOutCode.Found` and `InlineComment.InvalidEndChar` for stub pattern comments.

**Tradeoffs**
Allows PHPCS to exit 0 without renaming all PascalCase files or restructuring `namespace Public`. Cannot be removed until `public/Main.php` is renamed or the namespace changed.

**Future mistake prevented**
Do not attempt to "fix" these PHPCS violations inline — they require renaming files or restructuring namespaces, both of which are out of scope during migration phases.

**Evidence**
Feature 001 clarification Q4 (2026-05-29). All 6 modified files pass PHPCS exit 0.

**Where to look next**
`phpcs.xml.dist` — the `<rule ref="WordPress-Extra">` block contains all exclusion comments.

### 2026-05-29 — Activator Uses use Imports for DB Class References [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
Any file in namespace `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes` that references sub-namespace classes must use `use` imports — see BUGS.md B1.

**Decision**
All DB class references in `Activator.php` MUST use top-of-file `use … as` aliases (e.g. `use … MCPServer\Query as MCPServerQuery`). Bare relative names inside the `Includes` namespace produce a double-`Includes` FQN silently. Inline FQN strings in `class_exists()` are forbidden.

**Tradeoffs**
Slightly more verbose at file top; eliminates silent activation failures.

**Future mistake prevented**
Never write `class_exists( Includes\SomeClass::class )` inside a file in `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes`.

**Evidence**
BUGS.md B1 pattern. Feature 001 Activator.php lines 4-6 use correct `use` imports.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Activator.php` lines 1-10; any new file added to `includes/`.

### 2026-05-29 — Activator Does Not Call insert_default_server() [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
This separates Phase 2 activation responsibility from Phase 4 data-seeding responsibility.

**Decision**
Default MCP server row insertion is a Phase 4 concern deferred to `MCPServerQuery::maybe_create_table()` internal logic. `Activator::activate()` MUST NOT call any `insert_default_server()` method — it does not exist in Phase 1 and will not be an Activator responsibility.

**Tradeoffs**
Activator is simpler; data seeding is colocated with schema creation.

**Future mistake prevented**
Do not add `insert_default_server()` or similar seeding calls to `Activator.php`.

**Evidence**
Feature 001 clarification Q1 (2026-05-29). Spec FR-009 updated to reflect this.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Activator.php::activate()`, `includes/Database/MCPServer/Query.php::maybe_create_table()` (Phase 4).

### 2026-05-29 — AccessControl Stub Targets wpb-access-control Vendor Package [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
Phase 7 implementation MUST use the vendor package, not an internal wrapper class.

**Decision**
The `AccessControl` hook stub in `define_admin_hooks()` uses `\WPBoilerplate\AccessControl\AccessControlManager` from `wpboilerplate/wpb-access-control ^1.0`. Phase 7 MUST consume this package directly via Composer.

**Tradeoffs**
Creates a Composer dependency on a vendor package. Ensures no internal class diverges from the package.

**Future mistake prevented**
Do not create `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes\AccessControl\AccessControlManager` as an internal class — use the vendor package FQN.

**Evidence**
Feature 001 clarification Q2 (2026-05-29). Main.php stub line ~294.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Main.php::define_admin_hooks()`, `composer.json` (Phase 7 — add `wpb-access-control ^1.0`).
