### 2026-05-29 — Namespace Resolution Double-Includes in Activator.php

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
`class_exists( Includes\Database\MCPServer\Query::class )` inside
`Activator.php` always returns `false`. DB tables are never created at
activation. Activation completes silently with no error.

**Root Cause**
`Activator.php` is in namespace `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes`. PHP resolves
bare names relative to the current namespace. Writing `Includes\Database\MCPServer\Query`
inside that file produces the FQN `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes\Includes\Database\MCPServer\Query`
— a double-`Includes` path that resolves to nothing.

**Future mistake prevented**
Any file in `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes` that references a sub-namespace
class with a bare relative path (starting with `Includes\`) will silently fail.
This is especially dangerous in `class_exists()` checks, which return false
without throwing.

**Evidence**
Caught during `/speckit.plan` Phase 0 research (research.md §5).
Would have caused silent activation failures if deployed.

**Prevention / Detection**
ALWAYS use one of these forms inside any `AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes` file:
- `use AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes\Database\MCPServer\Query as MCPServerQuery;`
  then `class_exists( MCPServerQuery::class )`
- Or: `class_exists( \AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes\Database\MCPServer\Query::class )`
Run `vendor/bin/phpstan --level=8` — it catches unresolved class references.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Activator.php`, `includes/Main.php`, any file inside
`AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes` that references sibling sub-namespaces.

### 2026-05-29 — Uninitialised $this->plugin_name in define_constants()

**Status**
Active (fix applied in Feature 001; pattern to avoid in future)

**Symptoms**
`ACROSSAI_MCP_MANAGER_PLUGIN_NAME_SLUG` is defined as empty string / null.
All callers that reference the slug constant get an empty value.

**Root Cause**
`define_constants()` was called BEFORE `$this->plugin_name = 'acrossai-mcp-manager'`
in the constructor. `$this->plugin_name` is null at that point. The `define()`
guard accepted null silently.

**Future mistake prevented**
Never use `$this->property` as the value argument to `$this->define()` in
`define_constants()`. The properties are set AFTER this method returns.

**Evidence**
Found in existing `includes/Main.php`. Fixed in Feature 001 spec (FR-003).

**Prevention / Detection**
Code review: verify `define_constants()` uses only literals and
`ACROSSAI_MCP_MANAGER_PLUGIN_FILE` (defined at file scope before Main::instance()).

**Where to look next**
`includes/Main.php::define_constants()`

### 2026-05-29 — Namespace Drift in TODO Stub FQNs [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
`REST\CliController` TODO stub in `includes/Main.php` used namespace `\AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\REST\CliController` — missing `\Includes\` segment. Would fatal on uncomment in Phase 5.

**Root Cause**
Stub FQN not verified against the PSR-4 map in ARCHITECTURE.md before committing. Plan.md also contained the wrong FQN.

**Future mistake prevented**
Always verify every TODO stub FQN against the PSR-4 directory layout before writing it. Wrong-namespace stubs silently compile but fatal at runtime.

**Prevention / Detection**
Cross-check stub FQNs against ARCHITECTURE.md directory layout. PHPStan level 8 catches unresolved class references when the class exists; stubs won't be caught until the class is created.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Main.php` — all TODO stub comments containing `\AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\...` FQNs.

### 2026-05-29 — Unescaped Dot in PCRE Rewrite Rules [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
`add_rewrite_rule( '^.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/?$', ... )` matches any character in place of the leading dot — `axwell-known/...` would also match.

**Root Cause**
Inside a PHP single-quoted string passed to `add_rewrite_rule()`, `.` is a bare PCRE wildcard. Must be `\\.` (double-escaped: one `\` escapes the PHP string, leaving `\.` for PCRE).

**Future mistake prevented**
All literal dots in `add_rewrite_rule()` patterns must be `\\.` in single-quoted PHP strings, not `.`.

**Prevention / Detection**
Code review: grep for `add_rewrite_rule` and verify all literal `.` chars are `\\.`.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Activator.php` — all `add_rewrite_rule()` calls.

---

### 2026-05-29 — Public Constructor on Singleton Allows Double Hook Registration [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
External code calls `new \AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes\Main()` directly. All plugin hooks register twice. In Phase 7 this can cause double-fired access-control middleware.

**Root Cause**
`Includes\Main::__construct()` was `public` rather than `private`. The `final` class modifier prevents subclassing but not direct instantiation.

**Future mistake prevented**
Every singleton `__construct()` MUST be `private`. Constitution rule. A `final` class alone is not sufficient protection.

**Prevention / Detection**
PHPCS / code review: all classes with `static $_instance` must have `private function __construct()`.

**Where to look next**
Any new class added to `admin/`, `includes/`, or `public/` with `$_instance`.

---

### 2026-05-29 — Missing esc_url() on admin_url() Output [Feature-001]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
`sprintf('<a href="%sadmin.php?page=%s">', admin_url(), ...)` — `admin_url()` is filterable via the `admin_url` hook. A hijacked filter can return `javascript:alert(1)//`, producing stored XSS in the WP Admin plugins list.

**Root Cause**
`admin_url()` treated as a safe value because it typically returns a URL. It is not safe — it passes through a WordPress filter.

**Future mistake prevented**
Always wrap `admin_url()`, `get_admin_url()`, and similar filter-backed URL functions with `esc_url()` before use in any HTML attribute.

**Prevention / Detection**
PHPCS WPCS escaping sniffs. Code review: search for `admin_url()` in HTML context without `esc_url()` wrapper.

**Where to look next**
`admin/Partials/Menu.php` and any new admin Partials class with `plugin_action_links`.

### 2026-06-17 — Mass-Assignment via Forged POST Keys to Custom-Table Writes [Feature-002]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
A handler reads `$_POST` into a `$data` array and passes it to `$wpdb->update($table, $data, $where)` without filtering. A malicious admin (or a non-admin via a forged form that bypasses an upstream cap check) can include extra fields like `is_enabled=1`, `registered_from=plugin`, or future schema additions to write columns the form was never supposed to touch.

**Root Cause**
WP_DB `$wpdb->insert/update/delete` write every key in the `$data` array that corresponds to a column in the table — they do NOT filter against a schema whitelist. Trusting `$_POST` shape means trusting the attacker's shape.

**Future mistake prevented**
When writing to a custom DB table via a Query class, MUST iterate `Schema::columns()` (or an equivalent allow-list) and drop any unknown keys BEFORE the `$wpdb` call. Never pass raw `$data` from `$_POST` straight to `$wpdb->update/insert`.

**Prevention / Detection**
Canonical implementation pattern (see Feature 002):
```php
// In Query::update_item / add_item:
foreach ( $data as $col => $value ) {
    if ( ! $schema->has_column( (string) $col ) ) {
        continue; // silent drop
    }
    $update[ $col ] = ...;
}
```
Test: in a manual security test, submit a form with extra `<input name="is_enabled" value="1">` against the Claude Connector save handler. After submission, query the DB — the row's `is_enabled` MUST be unchanged.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Database/MCPServer/Query.php::add_item/update_item` for the canonical reference. Any future custom-table Query class MUST follow the same pattern.

---

### 2026-06-17 — "// esc_url'd above" Comment Pattern Is Fragile [Feature-002]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
A form action attribute reads `<?php echo $post_url; // esc_url'd above ?>`. The escape was applied 10 lines earlier when `$post_url = esc_url( add_query_arg(...) )` was assigned. Currently safe, but a future refactor that renames `$post_url`, moves the assignment, swaps the assignment for an unescaped value, or copy-pastes the echo line into a new render method silently breaks the escape — XSS reintroduced with no audit trail. PHPCS WPCS escaping sniffs may or may not see across the variable assignment.

**Root Cause**
The comment is documentation, not enforcement. The reviewer / linter / future author has no signal at the **output point** that the value is pre-escaped. Defense in depth fails because there's only one defense.

**Future mistake prevented**
Even when a value was already escaped at assignment time, re-escape it at the output point. `esc_url()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_html()` are all idempotent — calling them twice is cheap. The cost of being explicit is one function call; the cost of a silent regression is XSS.

**Prevention / Detection**
At output sites, always write `<?php echo esc_url( $post_url ); ?>` (or `esc_attr`, `esc_html`, etc.) — never bare `<?php echo $foo; ?>` with a "// already escaped" comment. PHPCS configurations should enable strict escaping rules at output sites regardless of upstream escaping. Pairs with B6 (admin_url XSS) for full coverage.

**Where to look next**
`admin/Partials/Settings.php` — every `<?php echo $post_url ?>` site has been hardened to `<?php echo esc_url( $post_url ); ?>` as of SEC-S2 (2026-06-17). Future render methods should follow that pattern.

### 2026-06-18 — PHPUnit 13+ `@dataProvider` Annotation Silently Fails [Feature-004]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
A test method using `@dataProvider providerMethod` annotation throws `ArgumentCountError: Too few arguments to function ... 0 passed ... and exactly N expected` at runtime. The annotation is silently ignored by PHPUnit 10+ (and definitively in PHPUnit 13); the test runs once with no arguments instead of N times with provider data.

**Root Cause**
PHPUnit 10 deprecated annotation-style metadata in favor of native PHP attributes; PHPUnit 13 removed annotation support entirely (still parses the docblock but doesn't bind the provider). The migration is silent — no deprecation warning at test-load time.

**Future mistake prevented**
When writing PHPUnit tests in this repo (currently 13.2-dev per `composer.json`), use PHP attributes, NOT docblock annotations:

```php
// WRONG (PHPUnit 13 silently ignores)
/**
 * @dataProvider providerMethod
 */
public function testFoo( string $a, string $b ): void { ... }

// CORRECT
use PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider;
#[DataProvider('providerMethod')]
public function testFoo( string $a, string $b ): void { ... }
```

The same applies to `@depends`, `@group`, `@test`, etc. — every annotation has an attribute equivalent in `PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\*`.

**Prevention / Detection**
PHPUnit's `--display-warnings` flag DOES surface this if enabled; otherwise the test silently fails with `ArgumentCountError`. Code review: search for `@dataProvider` (or any `@` test annotation) in new test files.

**Where to look next**
`tests/phpunit/MCPClients/AbstractMCPClientTest.php` for the canonical `#[DataProvider]` pattern + the `use PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider;` import.

### 2026-06-25 — Check-Then-Act on One-Shot Credentials MUST Use Atomic CAS [Feature-005]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
Two concurrent token-redemption requests with the same auth code both succeed: both issue access tokens, defeating the anti-replay guarantee. The "code already redeemed" check from the second request reads stale data because the first request hasn't yet flipped the `completed_at` flag.

**Root Cause**
The original FR-013 wrote `SELECT … WHERE redeemed_at IS NULL` followed by `UPDATE … SET redeemed_at = NOW()`. Under concurrent requests both SELECTs return NULL at T0 (predicate evaluates BEFORE either UPDATE), then both UPDATEs flip the flag at T1 — both pass their internal "not redeemed yet" check, both issue tokens. The same SELECT-then-UPDATE race exists in ANY DB-backed one-shot credential (auth codes, magic links, password-reset tokens, single-use coupons) and is silently exploitable under concurrent load.

**Fix Pattern (B10)**
The redemption step MUST be a single SQL statement of the form:

```sql
UPDATE <table>
SET completed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = :id AND completed_at IS NULL
```

Then inspect `$wpdb->rows_affected`:
- `1` → THIS request won the CAS, proceed with the privileged side effect
- `0` → another request already redeemed; fall through to the REPLAY branch (revoke any tokens issued by the sibling winner; return error; audit the replay attempt)

A `SELECT … WHERE completed_at IS NULL; if (! null) { UPDATE … }` pattern is NEVER acceptable for one-shot credentials, regardless of how short the window between SELECT and UPDATE is.

**Prevention / Detection**
- Code review gate: every new one-shot-credential redemption MUST include a concurrent-redeem PHPUnit test that runs the redemption N times against the SAME credential and asserts exactly ONE returns success (Phase 5 T054 `ConcurrentRedeemRaceTest` is the canonical shape).
- Audit gate: ANY token issued by the winner of an inverted CAS (the rare case where the loser's request issues a duplicate via a subsequent step) MUST be revoked in the replay branch.
- Grep gate: search for `SELECT.*WHERE.*completed_at IS NULL` followed by `UPDATE` — that's the regression pattern.

**Where to look next**
`includes/Database/CliAuthLog/Query.php::redeem_atomic` — the canonical CAS implementation. `includes/OAuth/Storage.php::redeem_authorization_code_cas` + `revoke_all_tokens_for_code` — the orchestration. `tests/phpunit/OAuth/ConcurrentRedeemRaceTest.php` — the load-bearing race test. `specs/005-oauth-connectors/spec.md` Q4 (SEC-001 amendment 2026-06-21) for the threat model.

### 2026-06-25 — Transient-Stored Associative Arrays Need Defensive Triple-Check on Read [Feature-006]

**Status**
Active

**Symptoms**
A read of a WordPress transient that's expected to hold an associative array (e.g. `array{user_id: int, server_id: string}`) returns the wrong shape and the calling code silently misbehaves — most often by reading `null` from a missing key, then comparing it to a real value with `===` (which returns false silently). Common failure modes:

- Object cache eviction during a partial write leaves the key set to `false` or to a different value-type than expected.
- A bug elsewhere in the code writes a bare `int` to the same key (e.g., during a refactor that changed the payload shape — this WAS the bug Q4 fixed).
- A transient TTL expires between two reads in the same request lifecycle.

**Root Cause**
PHP's `get_transient()` returns `false` on miss but ALSO returns `false` if the stored value is literally `false`. Combined with `isset()`'s lax "is the key set?" semantics (which returns `true` for an empty string `''`), naive single-line checks like `if ( false === $payload || ! is_numeric( $payload ) )` silently accept malformed data.

**Bug Pattern (B11)**
When reading a transient whose value is expected to be an associative array, use this triple-check pattern verbatim:

```php
$payload = get_transient( self::SOME_PREFIX . $key );
if ( ! is_array( $payload )                                            // catches false, scalars, objects
     || ! isset( $payload['expected_key_a'], $payload['expected_key_b'] )  // both keys present
     || ! is_numeric( $payload['expected_key_a'] )                     // value-type check for known-typed fields
) {
    return new \WP_Error( 'rest_unauthorized', '...', array( 'status' => 401 ) );
    // OR: return false from a static helper; OR: 404 from a polling endpoint
}
```

For transients with `array{key: int}` shape, use `is_numeric()` on the int field (catches strings that LOOK like ints AND real ints — WP transient storage strips int type on the wp_options fallback path). For `array{key: string}` fields, no additional check needed beyond `isset()`.

**Prevention**
- Code review gate: every `get_transient()` call that's expected to return an array MUST be followed by the triple-check.
- Static analysis: PHPStan L8 catches some shape mismatches but NOT runtime transient corruption — the triple-check is the runtime guard.
- Phase 5's `BearerAuth::resolve_bearer_token` (`includes/OAuth/BearerAuth.php`) reads a bare int value and uses a 2-line guard (`false === $user_id || ! is_numeric($user_id)`) — that's CORRECT for the bare-int shape. Phase 6's `verify_session_token` reads an array and uses the triple-check — that's the array-shape equivalent.

**Where to look next**
- Canonical implementation: `includes/REST/CliController.php::verify_session_token` (Phase 6) and `::handle_auth_status`.
- Counter-example (correct for the bare-int shape): `includes/OAuth/BearerAuth.php::resolve_bearer_token`.
- The Phase 6 Q4 clarification (`specs/006-rest-cli-auth/spec.md` §Clarifications) drove the array-shape adoption; prior-art bare-int reads in Phase 5 are fine because their payloads are bare ints, not arrays.

### 2026-06-30 — wp_enqueue_scripts Does Not Fire When template_redirect Exits Before wp_head() [Feature-007]

**Status**
Active — known failure mode for standalone HTML rendering via `template_redirect`

**Why this is durable**
WordPress fires the `wp_enqueue_scripts` action from inside `wp_head()`. Any handler hooked there only runs if the page goes through the theme rendering chain. When a plugin handles `template_redirect`, emits its own HTML, and `exit`s — the standard pattern for browser-mediated consent surfaces, well-known endpoints, JSON-LD pages, and custom Pretty URLs — `wp_head()` is never called and the `wp_enqueue_scripts` action never fires. Hooks wired via the Loader to `wp_enqueue_scripts` silently never run on these requests. The asset registration does not happen, and any subsequent `wp_print_styles( $handle )` call prints nothing because the style was never registered. The page renders unstyled with no error indication.

**Finding**
Wiring `enqueue_assets` to `wp_enqueue_scripts` via the Loader is necessary but not sufficient for `template_redirect`-based standalone pages. The page renderer MUST also call the enqueue method explicitly before `wp_print_styles()`, in addition to the hook wiring. The hook wiring is kept for future code paths that DO go through `wp_head()`; the explicit call covers the exit-before-head path. `wp_enqueue_style` is idempotent — both invocations are safe.

**Prevention**
- For any class wired to `wp_enqueue_scripts` that ALSO renders via `template_redirect` + `exit`, call the enqueue method explicitly from the render helper (e.g. `$this->enqueue_assets()` at the top of `render_page_shell()`).
- Test the asset registration with a dedicated PHPUnit case that asserts `wp_style_is( $handle, 'enqueued' )` after calling the render helper, NOT after firing `do_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts' )`. Firing the action would mask the gap because the test harness sees the hook fire, but production code paths don't.
- If the page later starts using `wp_head()` (e.g. a feature flag adds DataViews to the consent UI), the explicit call becomes a redundant no-op via idempotency — no breakage.

**Evidence**
- 2026-06-30 mid-implementation bug: `public/Partials/FrontendAuth.php` initially relied solely on the `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook wired in `Main::define_public_hooks()`. The consent page rendered without CSS because the action never fired on the `template_redirect` exit path.
- Fix: `public/Partials/FrontendAuth.php` `render_page_shell()` adds `$this->enqueue_assets();` before `wp_print_styles( 'acrossai-mcp-frontend' )`.
- Test coverage: `tests/phpunit/FrontendAuth/EnqueueAssetsTest.php` asserts state after calling the render helper directly, not after firing the hook.

**Where to look next**
`public/Partials/FrontendAuth.php` — the explicit `$this->enqueue_assets();` call inside `render_page_shell()` and the docblock comment above it. Any future standalone-HTML page plugin should grep `wp_print_styles` and verify a paired explicit `enqueue_assets()` call exists in the same render method.

### 2026-06-30 — wp_redirect Test Interception MUST Throw From Filter, Not Return False [Feature-007]

**Status**
Active — established WP-PHPUnit testing convention

**Why this is durable**
The standard production pattern for state-mutating GET endpoints is `wp_safe_redirect( $url ); exit;`. WP_UnitTestCase wraps `wp_die()` with a custom handler that throws `WPDieException` so the test runner can catch it — but it does NOT wrap `exit`. Returning false from the `wp_redirect` filter cancels the `header( 'Location: …' )` call (the filter's documented purpose) but does NOT prevent the surrounding code from reaching `exit;`. The test runner then terminates mid-test. This trap is subtle because the test sometimes appears to "work" — if PHPUnit happens to run the offending test last, the runner exit is invisible in the output.

**Finding**
To intercept `wp_redirect` / `wp_safe_redirect` calls in tests without losing the test runner, the filter MUST throw an exception. The exception propagates up through `wp_redirect()` to the calling code, which never reaches `exit`. The test catches the exception via `try { … } catch ( \RuntimeException $e ) { /* expected */ }`. The repo's existing convention (see `tests/phpunit/OAuth/ClaudeConnectorsDiscoveryTest.php` for the parallel `wp_die` handler pattern) uses `RuntimeException`.

**Prevention**
- Use this exact pattern for any redirect interception:
  ```php
  $redirect_target = null;
  add_filter(
      'wp_redirect',
      static function ( $location ) use ( &$redirect_target ) {
          $redirect_target = $location;
          throw new \RuntimeException( 'redirect_intercepted' );
      },
      10,
      1
  );
  ```
- Catch `\RuntimeException` (or `\Exception` if your test also catches `WPDieException` via the same try/catch).
- Reset `$redirect_target = null` between multiple calls in the same test, since the filter persists across calls.
- Add the filter BEFORE the first redirect-emitting call in the test, not after — order matters.

**Evidence**
- 2026-06-30 mid-implementation bug: `HandleApproveTest` + `MaybeRenderPageTest` initially used `return false` and the test runner died on the first `wp_safe_redirect` path.
- Fix: switched to `throw new \RuntimeException( 'redirect_intercepted' )` in `tests/phpunit/FrontendAuth/HandleApproveTest.php` and `tests/phpunit/FrontendAuth/MaybeRenderPageTest.php`.
- Repo precedent: `tests/phpunit/OAuth/ClaudeConnectorsDiscoveryTest.php` uses the same throw-from-handler pattern for `wp_die` interception (line ~49 of that file).

**Where to look next**
`tests/phpunit/FrontendAuth/HandleApproveTest.php` private helper `run_approve()` — the catch pattern that handles BOTH `WPDieException` AND `RuntimeException` in a single test entry point is the canonical implementation.

### 2026-07-02 — register_activation_hook default priority 10 vs. priority-1 vendor guard [Feature-010]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
WordPress's `register_activation_hook( __FILE__, 'callback' )` internally registers on the action `activate_<plugin-basename>` at default priority 10. A separate `add_action( 'activate_' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ ), ..., N )` with lower priority number N runs BEFORE the default-priority-10 callback (WP hook ordering: lower number = earlier). If the priority-10 activation callback tries to load composer classes and `vendor/` is missing, it FATALS with an unhelpful PHP error before any later-priority guard can wp_die() with a friendly message. Users see a wall of PHP fatal instead of "run composer install".

**Pattern to apply**
For any activation-time vendor-autoload / vendor-class-existence check that must gracefully wp_die() with a user-friendly message, register the check at priority 1 on `activate_<plugin-basename>`, BEFORE the default-priority-10 `register_activation_hook()` callback runs:

```php
add_action(
    'activate_' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ ),
    static function () {
        if ( ! file_exists( __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload_packages.php' ) ) {
            wp_die( esc_html__( 'Plugin cannot activate: run "composer install".', 'plugin-slug' ) );
        }
    },
    1  // Priority 1 — runs BEFORE the default-priority-10 activation callback
);
```

The two-hook pattern coexists cleanly:
- `register_activation_hook( __FILE__, 'activate_plugin' )` — priority 10, runs the actual activation work
- `add_action( 'activate_<basename>', fn() => guard, 1 )` — priority 1, runs FIRST, wp_die() early on missing prereqs

**Prevention rule**
For any activation-time prerequisite check that emits `wp_die()`, use `add_action('activate_' . plugin_basename(__FILE__), ..., 1)` — NEVER put the check inline in the register_activation_hook callback (which runs at default priority 10 and may fatal before your check).

**Evidence**
- `acrossai-mcp-manager.php:71–90` (Feature 010 / 2026-07-02 FR-030 implementation)
- `acrossai-abilities-manager/acrossai-abilities-manager.php:82–96` (Feature 038 reference implementation with `SEC-002` documentation)

**Where to look next**
For any future plugin activation prereq (PHP extension check, WP version check, MySQL feature check), apply the same priority-1 pattern. See D15 for the companion "shared package bootstrap in plugin entry file" pattern — B14 + D15 are the paired vendor-package resilience patterns.

### 2026-07-02 — Regex verification gates that pattern-match only the bare-name form silently miss FQN and short-name aliased forms [Feature-011]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
Grep-based cross-file verification gates that pattern-match a target symbol using a **single surface form** silently produce **false negatives** against the other legal PHP spellings of the same symbol:

1. **Leading-`\` FQN form**: WPCS-compliant code often writes `class Foo extends \WP_List_Table` (leading backslash) rather than `extends WP_List_Table` — the bare-name grep `'extends WP_List_Table'` returns 0.
2. **Short-name aliased form**: files that add `use AcrossAI_MCP_Manager\Includes\Database\MCPServer\Query;` at the top can call `new Query()` — the qualified-name grep `'new [A-Za-z_]*Query'` misses these because there's no prefix at the call site.

In both cases the gate reports "0 matches — PASS" while the underlying invariant is actually intact — masking the bug where a future regression IS present.

**Pattern to apply**
For every grep-based verification gate on a target class/method/const, use one of:

**Option A — Single ERE that accepts both forms** (preferred when the pattern is short):
```
# Matches both `extends WP_List_Table` and `extends \WP_List_Table`
grep -cE 'extends\s+\\?WP_List_Table' <file>

# Matches both `new MCPServerQuery()` and `new Query()`
grep -rEn '\bnew\s+([A-Za-z_\\]+\\)?Query\s*\(\s*\)' <files>
```

**Option B — Two grep passes** (use when the ERE gets awkward or when the fixed-string form is clearer):
```
# Pass 1: qualified form
grep -rEn '\bnew [A-Za-z_]*(MCPServer|CliAuthLog)Query\s*\(' <files>
# Pass 2: short-name form (bound via `use ...\Query;`)
grep -rEn '\bnew\s+Query\s*\(\s*\)' <files>
# Gate = both greps must be green
```

**Prevention rule**
Any grep-based verification gate MUST account for at minimum:
(a) The bare-name form of the target symbol.
(b) The leading-`\` FQN form of the target symbol.
(c) The short-name aliased form (bound via a `use` import) when the target is a class name.

Reviewers writing verification gates in `tasks.md` DoDs (or in FR grep contracts) MUST test the gate against BOTH the intended-pass state AND the intended-fail state before shipping — a gate that returns 0 on both healthy and broken code is worse than no gate at all, because it lulls reviewers into believing the invariant is being enforced.

**Evidence**
- **Manifestation 1 — DEV1 non-widening gate false negative**: Feature 011 `tasks.md` T032 (pre-fix) used `grep -c 'extends WP_List_Table' admin/Partials/CliAuthLogListTable.php` which returned 0 because the file has `class CliAuthLogListTable extends \WP_List_Table` (leading `\`). Architecture-review V1 (2026-07-02) caught it; T032 fixed to use `grep -cE 'extends\s+\\?WP_List_Table'`.
- **Manifestation 2 — Pre-flight callers grep missed short-name form**: Feature 011 `spec.md` FR-020 (pre-remediation) used `grep -rEn 'new [A-Za-z_]*(MCPServer|CliAuthLog|OAuthToken|OAuthAudit)[A-Za-z_]*Query'` which missed 11 caller sites in `admin/Partials/Settings.php` (× 7), `admin/Partials/MCPServerListTable.php`, `admin/Partials/ApplicationPasswords.php`, and `includes/Database/CliAuthLog/Recorder.php` that use `use ...\Query;` at the top and call `new Query()` (bare short-name). Whole-plugin gate T037 (2026-07-02) surfaced the survivors post-workflow; FR-020 fixed to require a two-pass grep.

**Where to look next**
`tasks.md` T032 (post-V1-fix) shows the canonical `extends\s+\\?<Class>` idiom.
`spec.md` FR-020 (post-I1-fix) shows the two-pass idiom (qualified + short-name via `use`).
Any future FR that codifies a grep gate for a rename sweep or boundary preservation should reference this B15 entry in its DoD line.

### 2026-07-03 — Mixed positional/numbered printf placeholders in a single format string silently mislabel output [Feature-012]

**Status**
Active

**Why this is durable**
PHP's `printf`/`sprintf` accept BOTH positional (`%s`) and numbered (`%1$s`, `%2$s`, ...) placeholders in the same format string without an error. When you concatenate a positional-`%s` format-string with a numbered-`%1$s`/`%2$s`/`%3$s` i18n string (a common pattern when you want translator-friendly `wp_kses_post( __( 'metadata: <code>%1$s</code> ...' ) )` snippets inside a larger admin layout), the numbered placeholders bind to the FIRST N arguments — NOT to the arguments you appended AFTER the leading text arguments. Result: labels or URLs display against the wrong slot with no PHP warning, no PHPStan complaint, no PHPCS violation. The bug is invisible until visual QA catches the mislabeled output.

Feature 012 hit this in `SettingsMenu.php::render_claude_connectors_section_description()`: a single `printf` concatenated `'<p>%s</p>...<p><strong>%s</strong> %s</p>' . wp_kses_post( __( 'Authorization server metadata: <code>%1$s</code><br>Authorize URL: <code>%2$s</code><br>Token endpoint: <code>%3$s</code>' ) )` with 4 leading text-arg `%s` slots followed by 3 URL args. The rendered output showed `"Authorization server metadata: Optional direct Claude Connectors mode. Use this page only to turn the experimental feature on or off."` — because `%1$s` reached for the FIRST arg (the description label), not the AS metadata URL (which was arg 5).

**Pattern to apply**
When a `printf`/`sprintf` needs to compose a positional-`%s` outer layout with an i18n string that internally uses numbered `%1$s`/`%2$s` placeholders (usually because translators need the numbered form for word-order flexibility), do NOT concatenate the two format strings. Instead:

**Option A — Split into two calls** (preferred; each `printf` sees only ONE placeholder style):
```php
// Outer layout uses positional %s only:
printf(
    '<div class="notice notice-warning inline"><p><strong>%1$s</strong> %2$s</p><p>%3$s</p></div>',
    esc_html__( 'Do not cache the URLs.', 'text-domain' ),
    esc_html__( 'Long explanatory sentence.', 'text-domain' ),
    // Inner sprintf isolates the numbered placeholders inside their own i18n string:
    sprintf(
        /* translators: 1: AS metadata URL, 2: authorize URL, 3: token URL */
        wp_kses_post( __( 'AS metadata: <code>%1$s</code><br>Authorize: <code>%2$s</code><br>Token: <code>%3$s</code>', 'text-domain' ) ),
        esc_url( $as_metadata_url ),
        esc_url( $authorize_url ),
        esc_url( $token_url )
    )
);
```

Since the inner `sprintf` returns a fully-formatted string with all URLs already substituted, it can safely be passed to the outer `printf` as an ordinary `%s` argument (marked with `// phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped` because the sniff can't statically see the `esc_url()`+`wp_kses_post()` chain — the escape is proven by construction).

**Option B — Convert everything to numbered form** (works only when the outer layout is ALSO a translated string; often it isn't):
```php
printf(
    /* translators: 1: label, 2: URL */
    wp_kses_post( __( '<strong>%1$s</strong>: <code>%2$s</code>', 'text-domain' ) ),
    esc_html( $label ),
    esc_url( $url )
);
```

**Prevention rule**
NEVER concatenate a format string containing `%s` with a format string containing `%1$s`/`%2$s`/`%3$s` inside a single `printf`/`sprintf` call. If the composition needs both styles (translated inner + literal outer, or vice versa), split into two calls where each format string uses ONE placeholder style consistently. Code review checkpoint: any `printf( '...' . wp_kses_post( __( '...%1$s...' ) ), ... )` line is a red flag.

**Evidence**
- **Manifestation**: Feature 012 `admin/Partials/SettingsMenu.php::render_claude_connectors_section_description()` (pre-fix) displayed "Authorization server metadata: Optional direct Claude Connectors mode..." because `%1$s` bound to the FIRST arg (description text) instead of the intended `esc_url( $as_metadata_url )` at arg-5. Reported by user during smoke QA (2026-07-03 session).
- **Fix commit**: Refactor to 3 separate `printf` calls; URL block built via nested `sprintf` with its own isolated numbered-placeholder i18n string.
- **Static analysis blindspot**: PHPStan L8 + PHPCS both passed on the buggy code — the mix is legal PHP; only runtime output revealed the label swap.

**Where to look next**
Any admin partial that emits `wp_kses_post( __( '...%1$s...%2$s...' ) )`-style translated snippets inside a larger `printf` call — verify each such call uses ONE placeholder style. Sibling `acrossai-abilities-manager` `SettingsMenu.php:212-220` shows the pattern working correctly because it uses positional `%s` throughout with no numbered-placeholder concatenation. Sibling wordpress-ai copy at `src/Admin/Settings.php:490-506` uses full `<?php ... ?>`-tag rendering which bypasses printf entirely — either idiom is safe; the mixed-mode idiom is the trap.
